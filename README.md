# Animal Image Classifier
This project aims to build a learning model that is capable of identifying an animal in a provided image using Google Colab. The dataset used to train the model is the Animals-10 dataset from Kaggle. The model can identify and label an image under one of the 10 different animal categories.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to:
- Use a convolutional neural network (CNN) to build a learning model to identify animals in a given image
- Utilise a pre-trained ResNet model trained on ImageNet as the foundation
- Train the model using images from the Animals-10 dataset
- Evaluate the model using standard metrics (accuracy, recall etc.)
- Allow users to upload an image and get predictions

## Prerequisites
To run this project, you need:
- A Google Colab account (or any python environment with GPU support)
- An internet connection
- Basic knowledge of python and machine learning concepts

## Contributions
If you'd like to contribute to this project, feel free to:
- Improve the data preprocessing pipeline
- Optimize the model for better performance
- Add new categories of animals
